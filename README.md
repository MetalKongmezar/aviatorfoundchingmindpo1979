## Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

### Understanding the Aviator Game

Aviator is a simple yet exciting game where you must cash out before the
plane flies away. The higher the plane goes, the bigger the multiplier,
but if you wait too long, you risk losing everything.

### Step-by-Step Playing Guide

1.  **Place Your Bet**: At the start of each round, choose your bet
    amount.
2.  **Watch the Plane**: A plane takes off, and as it flies higher, the
    multiplier increases.
3.  **Cash Out**: You must decide when to cash out before the plane
    flies away. If you cash out in time, you win your bet multiplied by
    the current multiplier.
4.  **Risk and Reward**: The longer you wait, the higher the
    multiplier---but waiting too long could make you lose the entire bet
    if the plane flies away.

### Tips for Playing Aviator

-   **Start with Small Bets**: Especially if you're new to the game,
    starting with small bets can help you understand the game mechanics
    without risking much.
-   **Be Patient**: Don't rush to cash out too soon; observe the game to
    identify any patterns.
-   **Know When to Cash Out**: It's crucial to balance risk and reward.
    Cash out when you've secured a decent multiplier rather than waiting
    for a massive but risky payout.
